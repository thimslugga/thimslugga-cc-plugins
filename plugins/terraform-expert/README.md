### Terraform Tasks Skill

Autonomous skill for executing complex Terraform operations including infrastructure code generation, version management, debugging, security scanning, architecture review, CI/CD pipeline creation, module development, and resource migration.

## Usage Examples

### Example 1: Initialize a New Azure Project

```text
User: Help me initialize a new Terraform project for Azure

Agent: I'll help you initialize a Terraform project for Azure with best practices.
First, let me ask a few questions:
- What Terraform version are you using?
- Which AzureRM provider version?
- Do you need remote state backend?

[Creates complete project structure with all necessary files]
```

### Example 2: Generate Secure Infrastructure

```text
User: Create an Azure Storage Account with all security best practices

Agent: [Detects your Terraform/provider versions]
[Generates complete configuration with encryption, private endpoints, network rules]
[Runs security scan and confirms all checks pass]
```

### Example 3: Debug Issues

```text
User: My terraform plan is failing with authentication error on Windows

Agent: [Identifies Windows platform and Azure CLI authentication issue]
[Provides PowerShell commands to diagnose and fix]
[Explains root cause and prevention]
```

### Example 4: CI/CD Pipeline

```text
User: /terraform-expert:tf-cicd

Agent: [Generates complete CI/CD pipeline for your platform]
[Includes security scanning, approval gates, drift detection]
[Provides OIDC setup instructions]
```

### Example 5: Architecture Review

```text
User: /terraform-expert:tf-architecture

Agent: [Analyzes your current structure]
[Identifies anti-patterns and proposes improvements]
[Provides migration plan and ADR documentation]
```

### Example 6: Import Existing Resources ⭐ NEW

```text
User: /terraform-expert:tf-import

Agent: I'll help you import existing infrastructure into Terraform.

First, let me understand your situation:
- Which cloud provider? (Azure/AWS/GCP)
- How many resources need to be imported?
- Do you have Terraform 1.5+ (for import blocks)?

User: Azure, about 20 resources in a resource group, Terraform 1.7

Agent: Perfect! For Terraform 1.5+, I recommend using import blocks.

Step 1: Let me help you inventory the resources:
[Provides Azure CLI commands to list all resources]

Step 2: Create import blocks:
[Generates import.tf with all 20 resources]

Step 3: Generate configuration:
terraform plan -generate-config-out=generated.tf

[Provides complete workflow with verification steps]
```

### Example 7: State Management ⭐ NEW

```text
User: I need to rename a resource and move it to a module

Agent: I'll help you refactor your Terraform structure safely.

Current structure:
resource "azurerm_virtual_network" "vnet"

Target structure:
module "networking" {
  # contains azurerm_virtual_network.vnet
}

Steps:
1. Backup state first:
   terraform state pull > backup-$(date +%Y%m%d).json

2. Move resource to module:
   terraform state mv azurerm_virtual_network.vnet module.networking.azurerm_virtual_network.vnet

3. Verify (should show no changes):
   terraform plan

[Provides complete commands with safety checks]
```

## Best Practices

### Version Management

- Always pin Terraform and provider versions in production
- Use pessimistic version constraints (~>)
- Review changelogs before upgrading
- Test upgrades in non-production first

### State Management

- Use remote backend (Azure Storage, S3, GCS, Terraform Cloud)
- Enable state locking
- Enable versioning on backend storage
- Restrict access with RBAC/IAM

### Security

- Never commit secrets to code
- Use secret management services
- Run security scanning in CI/CD
- Enforce HTTPS/TLS everywhere
- Implement least privilege IAM/RBAC

### Code Quality

- Run terraform fmt before committing
- Use pre-commit hooks
- Implement CI/CD validation
- Document all modules

### CI/CD

- Separate plan and apply stages
- Require approval for production
- Save plans as artifacts
- Implement drift detection
