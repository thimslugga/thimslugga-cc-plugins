## CRITICAL GUIDELINES

### Windows File Path Requirements

## MANDATORY: Always Use Backslashes on Windows for File Paths

When using Edit or Write tools on Windows, you MUST use backslashes (`\`) in file paths, NOT forward slashes (`/`).

# Bash Script Analyzer

## Purpose

Perform comprehensive analysis of bash scripts covering security vulnerabilities, performance issues, portability concerns, and adherence to modern best practices.

## Analysis Categories

### 1. Security Analysis

- Command injection vulnerabilities
- Path traversal risks
- Unsafe temporary file handling
- Unquoted variable expansions
- Privilege escalation risks
- Sensitive data exposure
- Race condition vulnerabilities

### 2. Performance Analysis

- Unnecessary subshell spawning
- Inefficient loops (UUOC, UUOG)
- External command overuse vs bash builtins
- Pipeline optimization opportunities
- Array usage efficiency
- Process substitution opportunities

### 3. Portability Analysis

- Bash version compatibility (4.x, 5.x features)
- POSIX compliance level
- Platform-specific issues (Linux/macOS/BSD)
- GNU vs BSD tool differences
- Shebang portability

### 4. Best Practices Compliance

- ShellCheck warnings (all severity levels)
- Google Shell Style Guide adherence
- Error handling patterns
- Cleanup and trap usage
- Function structure and modularity
- Documentation and comments

## Analysis Output Format

For each script analyzed, provide:

```text
## Script: <filename>

## Analysis Checklist

When analyzing scripts, systematically check:

### Security Checklist

- [ ] All variables quoted in command arguments
- [ ] No eval with user input
- [ ] No unvalidated external input in commands
- [ ] Temp files created securely (mktemp)
- [ ] No world-readable sensitive data
- [ ] Proper file permission handling
- [ ] No symlink following vulnerabilities

### Performance Checklist

- [ ] Using bash builtins over external commands
- [ ] Avoiding unnecessary subshells
- [ ] Using arrays instead of string parsing
- [ ] Efficient file reading patterns
- [ ] Process substitution where appropriate
- [ ] Avoiding cat | grep (UUOC)
- [ ] Using mapfile for file reading

### Portability Checklist

- [ ] Shebang uses /usr/bin/env bash or /bin/bash
- [ ] Bash version requirements documented
- [ ] No undocumented bashisms
- [ ] GNU/BSD command compatibility
- [ ] Works on major platforms

### Best Practices Checklist

- [ ] set -euo pipefail at start
- [ ] trap for cleanup on EXIT
- [ ] Functions under 50 lines
- [ ] Proper error messages to stderr
- [ ] Meaningful exit codes
- [ ] ShellCheck passes with zero warnings
- [ ] Consistent coding style

## Usage Examples

**Analyze single script:**

```text
/bash-analyze backup.sh
```

**Analyze directory:**

```text
/bash-analyze scripts/
```

**Focus on security:**

```text
/bash-analyze deploy.sh focus on security vulnerabilities
```

**Check portability:**

```text
/bash-analyze build.sh check POSIX compliance
```

## After Analysis

Based on findings, I will:

1. Provide detailed analysis report
2. List all issues with severity ratings
3. Give specific fix recommendations
4. Offer to fix issues automatically if requested
5. Suggest architectural improvements if needed
