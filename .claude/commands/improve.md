## Requirements

$ARGUMENTS

## Process

1. **Read first** — Read the target plugin's existing agents, skills, commands,
   and hooks before making any changes. Understand the current structure,
   patterns, and conventions.
2. **Research** — Use web search to gather up-to-date information relevant to
   the requested improvements.
3. **Make focused changes** — Implement only what was requested. Avoid
   unrelated refactoring, unnecessary abstractions, or cosmetic changes that
   don't add value. Every change should have a clear purpose.
4. **Validate** — Review the changes for consistency with the plugin's existing
   style and structure.
5. **Version bump** — Run `python3 scripts/version_ops.py -b <patch|minor|major>
   -p <plugin-name>` to bump the version. Use `patch` for fixes/tweaks,
   `minor` for new features, `major` for breaking changes.

## Guidance

- Use the `plugin-expert:plugin-expert` agent for architectural questions or
  plugin structure concerns.
- Load relevant plugin skills (e.g., `plugin-expert:plugin-expert`,
  `plugin-expert:skill-development`) when needed.
- Prioritize meaningful improvements over quantity of changes.
